# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to Yolo AgentMemory must be documented here.
Add entries under **Unreleased** while coding, then move them to a dated release
section when tagging a version. This keeps the project aligned with the global
documentation policy (CHANGELOG + README updates in the same PR as the code).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial backlog: Codex rollout parser, SQLite storage with semantic search
